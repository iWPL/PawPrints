Pawprints Pet Sitting & Home Visits
Pawprints Dog Training & Pet Care Services offer weekday pet sitting and home visits in Horley, Crawley and surrounding areas. It may be possible to accomodate ad-hoc weekend and Bank Holiday petsitting and home visits upon request. 

A Home Visit can be for either 20, 30 or 45 minutes, and how this time is spent will vary depending on your individual pet's needs. It could be a relaxed potter about your garden, doing some calm sniffy enrichment; more lively mentally stimulating activities and playing; or simply relaxing with some company on the sofa. If your pets need any food or medication, this can be given too.

For small pets, a home visit may entail some gentle handling and enrichment activities, cage cleaning, feeding and watering. I am experienced with a wide range of different pets, including rabbits, guinea pigs, chinchillas, birds, bearded dragons, snakes, tortoises, terrapins, and fish, having had many of my own over the years.

A Pet-Sitting visit will be for a longer period of time, and can be tailored to suit you and your pet's needs.
