Darrell Hobbs Photography
Pawprints Dog Training & Pet Care Services has teamed up with the amazing Darrell Hobbs Photography to help you capture that perfect portrait of your pet, showing their true personality.

Darrell has a wealth of experience with a range of different types of pets, including dogs, rabbits, birds, tortoises, snakes and more. Allowing your pet to feel relaxed and comfortable is an essential first step in being able to capture the best photographs, and using calm and empathetic positive reinforcement to help your pet feel at ease with the wierd man pointing the big camera at them, Darrell always gets good results!

Bespoke photography sessions for you and your pet can be arranged in a suitable indoor or outdoor location around Horley, Crawley and surrounding areas. Action shots, scenic photos, and studio style portraits can all be done, as well as full family pictures. Moments you will treasure forever. Why not combine a photography session with a Pawprints one-to-one training session, or a Pawprints dog walk?

A small selection of Darrell's photography can be found throughout this website, and in the gallery below:
